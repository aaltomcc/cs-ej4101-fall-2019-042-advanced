What is DevOps? Why is everyone talking about it? Should I know about it?

These were the thoughts that I had in my first summerjob. Later when I was planning my studies 
I noticed a cource named Introduction to DevOps. This is perfect, I thought. Ether I will learn what 
everyone wastalking about, or I will notice that I already knew. I just didn't know the names.
