# This course 042  
What is DevOps? Everyone is talking about it, but should I know what is it?
These were the thoughts that I had during my first summer in my trainee job. Later when I was planning my studies for this autumn, I spotted a course ‘Introduction to DevOps’. This sounds perfect, I thought. I will have nice thought out and coherent info package about the topic. And maybe I will learn something new, that might help me at my current trainee position, or future jobs.  
So, what I was expecting to learn? I had heard the word DevOps pop-up in discussion or message thread, but I couldn’t have defined the word or what it actually meant if someone had asked. I already knew some tools that are related to DevOps. Everyone was also excited about these tools and DevOps. I was expecting to learn about the basic concepts and where to learn more. I have had couple of introductory courses before. They usually offer exactly this, basic concepts and some tips how to learn more. The courses are often quite light compared to some more advanced ones, so they give nice change to studies. The course is also an online course which made it very easy to fit it to my schedule. Course has no pre-requires, so it won’t be too advanced.  
The course has a project, which means that there is some hands-on working. It always makes my learning more efficient when I can actually use what I have been reading about.
