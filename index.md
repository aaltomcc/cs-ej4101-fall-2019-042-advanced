# About me

I am Ona. I am a student from Aalto university. My interest towards software development started from my summer job as a software testing trainee.

During my studies Iâ€™ve learned some basic programming skills and at work, how software development can be organized from the perspective of testing. I enjoyed the summer job so much that I decided to continue working part time.

After starting the job, I have also studied couple of elective courses about programming, software development, and now DevOps. Maybe I will find my future job among software development or testing, or just a fun and educative hobby.
